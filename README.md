## Community

This repo exists to define a single source of truth for consensus-critical sections of the protocol, such as verification and state transition rules.

The objective of the Solana Protocl Specification and Tests (SPSaT) initiative is to produce a complete implementati0n formal specifications and langusage agnostic conformance tests expanding coverage to major components.

Other documentation regarding widely adopted protocols may be added at the discretion of the Solana Foundation.
