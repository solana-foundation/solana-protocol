## Community

This repo exists to define a single source of truth for consensus-critical sections of the protocol, such as verification and state transition rules.

The first long-term objective of the specification effort is to produce a complete and unambiguous Solana validator implementati0n specifications and conformance tests.

Other documentation regarding widely adopted protocols may be added at the discretion of the Solana Foundation.
